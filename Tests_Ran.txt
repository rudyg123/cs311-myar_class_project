Testing

I ran each the following tests from the makefile indiviudally and as part of the group batch runs:

Tested the -q option of my program:
  testq12345
  testq135
  testq24

Testing the -t option
  testt12345
  testt135
  testt24

Testing the -v option
  testv12345
  testv135
  testv24


Additionally, I did some custom tests:
  Creating a corrupted archive file and ran my code against it to see if it would catch it.   Tested the ability to add more files to an exiting archve for the -q and -A options.
  Tested the -d option repeatedly on an existing archive.
